# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The project includes a responsive design and a scoreboard to keep track of the players' scores.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure to have an active internet connection to load external resources.

## Game Rules

The rules of Tic Tac Toe are straightforward:

- Players take turns marking an empty space on the 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- **style.css:** The stylesheet for styling the game layout.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## How to Play

- Click on any empty box to mark it with either "X" or "O."
- Players take turns clicking on the boxes.
- The game announces the winner when a player gets three in a row.
- If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Scoring

The scoreboard keeps track of the number of rounds won by each player. The scores are updated dynamically as the game progresses.

## Reset and New Game

- The "Reset" button allows players to reset the current round without affecting the overall scores.
- The "Home" button takes players back to the top of the page.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots of the game interface, a sample round, and the scoreboard.
